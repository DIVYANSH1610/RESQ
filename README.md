📌 Problem Statement

Problem Statement 9 – Weaving AI Magic with Groq — Introducing RESQ


---

🎯 Objective

During natural disasters, people often lack real-time, location-specific information, leading to panic, delayed evacuations, and uncoordinated rescue efforts.
RESQ solves this by providing instant alerts, guided evacuation, and volunteer coordination, connecting users to the nearest safe zones (Quell Zones) and ensuring rapid support when every second counts.

Our Approach:

Chose this problem to save lives during unpredictable crises using AI-powered systems.

Key challenges: Real-time routing under dynamic disaster conditions, reliable volunteer coordination, and minimal delay communication.

Breakthrough: Creation of AutoQ, a predictive routing system that dynamically adapts as disasters evolve, and Q-link, for seamless real-time volunteer interaction.
